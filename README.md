# PacBio_Rename_All_Unique_Ids_To_Well_Names_From_XML

Quick script I wrote in 20 mins (already had written all code before in previous projects aside from pulling tags from xml) to take all consensus xml files in all samples, rename all unique id folders to their respective well names. Uses [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). Outputs the shell commands to rename folders.
